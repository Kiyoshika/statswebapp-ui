# TODO Checklist
My general TODO items in no particular order:
* Add context menu when clicking dataset with the following options:
  * View
  * Remove
  * Rename
* Make dataset panel scrollable
* Send file to server
* Create session ID when user opens application (will need server for this)
* Use Vuex store for color codes instead of hardcoding them everywhere. This will make it much easier to scale & manage future components (especially in cases of overhauls)
