# TODO Checklist
My general TODO items in no particular order:
* On "View Data" call the API to fetch dataset and render it as a new tab on the TabPanel
* Make dataset panel scrollable
* Add limit to 10 datasets per client
* Use Vuex store for color codes instead of hardcoding them everywhere. This will make it much easier to scale & manage future components (especially in cases of overhauls)
