# statswebapp UI
This is the UI for a statistics web application (see [here](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/statswebapp-api) for the backend).

The vision for this project is to import CSV data and generate visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, etc.) as well as statistical models and perform statistical tests (t-test, anova, etc.).

I am inexperienced with web development so don't expect this code to be grand.
